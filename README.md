# Finance-Dashboard
This Power BI project delivers a complete Finance Performance Dashboard built on a fully cleaned and structured dataset processed in Power Query. The transformation process begins by importing the raw CSV file using the Csv.Document connector, followed by promoting the first row to column headers to create a readable and organized structure. Each field in the dataset is then assigned an appropriate data type: text fields such as Segment, Country, Product, Discount Band, and Month Name are standardized as text; financial columns including Units Sold, Manufacturing Price, Sale Price, Gross Sales, Sales, and COGS are converted into currency types; and date-related fields—Date, Month Number, and Year—are assigned proper date and whole-number formats. Two key fields, Discounts and Profit, were mistakenly recognized as text during the initial import, so they are corrected in a second type-conversion step to ensure financial accuracy. To maintain data integrity, the script removes any rows that produce errors in the Discount or Profit columns, ensuring that the final dataset used for reporting is clean, reliable, and fully analysis-ready. The final table returned from the "Removed Errors1" step serves as the structured foundation for all downstream visuals and DAX measures in the dashboard.

On the visualization side, the dashboard presents a modern, business-oriented layout designed for clarity and quick decision-making. An executive KPI header highlights the most important metrics—Total Revenue, Total Profit, Units Sold, and Average Sale Price—accompanied by sparkline trends to show performance movement at a glance. Time-series charts illustrate revenue and profit over time, allowing users to instantly identify seasonal patterns and growth trends. A segmented bar chart breaks down performance by business segments such as Government, Midmarket, Small Business, and Enterprise, helping users understand which segments drive the most value. A country-level visual adds a geographical perspective, while product-level insights allow detailed performance comparison. An interactive table with conditional formatting and data bars provides a granular financial breakdown across products, countries, and segments, making it easy to spot strong and weak performers. All visuals are fully slicer-enabled, allowing filters by segment, product, country, discount band, and date, ensuring a highly interactive and user-driven analysis experience. The combination of strong data preparation in Power Query and a polished visualization layer results in a clean, professional financial dashboard ideal for corporate use, analytics portfolios, and GitHub demonstration.
