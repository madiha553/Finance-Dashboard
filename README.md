# Finance-Dashboard
This project showcases an end-to-end Finance Performance Dashboard developed in Power BI, designed to help users analyze revenue, profit, sales trends, and product-level performance with full interactivity. The dataset was imported from a CSV file and thoroughly prepared using Power Query before modeling and visualization. During transformation, I promoted headers, standardized data types for all financial and categorical fields, converted key columns such as Units Sold, Manufacturing Price, Sale Price, Gross Sales, Sales, and COGS into currency format, and correctly assigned date and integer types for the time intelligence fields. Additionally, I resolved all data quality issues by removing rows with errors in the Discounts and Profit columns to ensure smooth calculations across visuals and DAX measures. This cleaning process produced a reliable dataset that supports accurate reporting and trend analysis.

After preparing the data, I designed an interactive dashboard that walks users from high-level KPIs to detailed operational insights. The top section highlights core metrics—Total Revenue ($109.93M), Profit ($15.16M), Units Sold (1.03M), and Average Sale Price ($120.53)—each paired with trendlines to show performance movement over time. Below that, I integrated visuals that break the story down further: a pie chart illustrates revenue distribution across segments like Government, Small Business, Enterprise, and Midmarket, making it easy to identify which category contributes most to total business value. A waterfall chart displays the profit contribution of each product, helping stakeholders understand which items drive financial growth and which ones require attention. On the right side, I added a detailed matrix enriched with conditional formatting bars for Revenue, Units Sold, and Profit, enabling quick comparison of performance across segments, products, countries, and discount bands.

To enhance usability, the dashboard includes slicers for Date, Product, Country, Segment, and Discount Band, allowing analysts and business users to filter and drill into specific scenarios without modifying the underlying dataset. The overall design focuses on clarity and functionality, using a professional layout, consistent color themes, and clean visual hierarchy. This repository contains the Power BI dashboard image, the M-language Power Query script, and all supporting assets required to understand and reproduce the report. The final result is a versatile analytical tool suitable for executive reviews, product-level profitability analysis, and data-driven decision-making.

Overall, this dashboard gave me a clear picture of how the business is performing and where improvements can be made. While revenue is strong and sales volumes are high, profitability isn’t increasing at the same pace, pointing to potential inefficiencies in costs or discount structures. The Government and Small Business segments emerged as the most reliable revenue drivers, showing stable purchasing behavior and consistent contribution to the bottom line. In contrast, some product categories and regions displayed lower margins despite high sales, suggesting opportunities to revisit pricing strategies, optimize discounts, or rebalance product focus. By analyzing trends across countries, segments, products, and time periods, I was able to pinpoint exactly where performance is strong and where there is room for strategic enhancement. This analysis not only highlights current strengths but also reveals actionable opportunities that could significantly improve future financial outcomes.
